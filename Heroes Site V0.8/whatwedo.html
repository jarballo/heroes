			<p>HEROES (helping educators revive our economic success) is a standards-based classroom curriculum supplement and online platform for 
			networking K-12 teachers to guest speakers from the community to apply students' academic content to the real world. The connections we
			foster between students and professional guest speakers have at least three important implications for students' future success:</p>
			<br/>
			<p>First, students are more engaged in their classroom learning because they understand how it is relevant to their success in college and their future careers.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>Secondly, students gain broad exposure to diverse careers and professions in order to answer the question of what they want to be when they grow up.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>Finally, students are empowered when they relate with community members who offer diverse experiences, knowledge, and skills such that students can begin to imagine themselves achieving similar outcomes in the future through hard work and perseverance.</p>
			<br/>
			<br/>
			
			
			<p>CHANGE: We seek to develop business-education partnerships that will create transformational change in ways that businesses are able to 
			successfully grow, connect with, and retain their customers through community support. We also value ways these relationships will bring 
			transformational change to students&apos; education, so students are able to critically think and apply their education to their future college 
			and career opportunities.<p>
			<br/>
			<br/>
			
			<p>KNOWLEDGE UTILIZATION AND APPLICATION: The business community understands the knowledge and skills the incoming workforce must have 
			in order to be successful in a rapidly changing global market. We must share this understanding with students and educators at all levels to 
			develop the critical thinking skills that are necessary to apply students&apos; daily learning to the real world. </p>
			<br/>
			<br/>
			
			<p>INNOVATION: We understand that the current students will be the next workforce of this nation. By connecting classroom learning to post-secondary professions, students will be able to innovatively create solutions for tomorrow&apos;s challenges. By connecting with students and 
			educators, businesses will benefit as they gain experience innovatively preparing students for college and career readiness, which ultimately 
			will increase the quality of their future workforce.</p>
			<br/>
			<br/>
			
			<p>DIVERSITY: We seek a diverse group of businesses to partner with educators to expose students and educators to the variety of ways 
			academic content applies to the real world. This requires a diversity of professions to partner with our schools. Additionally, the future 
			workforce is increasingly diverse culturally, and we strive to seek partnerships with community professionals who reflect the diversity of 
			the students we serve. </p>
