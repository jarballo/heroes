HEROES is a standadards-based classroom curriculum supplement and online platform for netowrking K-12 teachers to community role models.
		The goal is to help educators revive economic success. The organization engages students in their academic content by connecting them to community guest speakers. 
		Each Heroes interaction	has three components: 1.)Exposing students to a diversity of careers, 2.)engaging students in the real world application of their academic content
		and 3.)empowering students to set and reach ambitious goals. A teacher creates a profile based on the topic they are teaching. A community role model creates a 
		profile indicating their professional experiences. A teacher and community role model are then matched based on what would best compliment student learning.
		
		Our team's primary goals are to give the existing website a more modern look, to improve the interface with users to make the experience more intuitive and easier to navigate and to allow interfacing of the website with PayPal, Facebook, LinkeIn and similar social media sites. We plan on achieving these goals by creating new content and improving already existing content for the heroesforstudents.org.
		
		Heroes for Students' co-founders are Richie Ressel and Dr. Chris Reina. The Heroes project team members are Charles Brown, Ed Sharp, Tom Sharp, William Sugihara and Arick Hanna.
